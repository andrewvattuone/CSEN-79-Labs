The following scenarios all need to be tested:

1. Insertion of an element when the array is completely emtpy

2. Insertion of an element when the array has some elements but isn't completely full

3. Insertion of an element when the array is completely full

4. Deletion of a student in the array based on the inputted ID number

5. Deletion of a student in the array when the inputted ID number doesn't exist in the array

6. Deleting the same student twice

7. Listing of all students in a full roster

8. Listing of all students in a partially full roster

9. Listing an empty roster

To run the tests, use the following commands:
./rostertest < testinput.txt > testoutput.txt
diff testoutput.txt expectedoutput.txt

The input file contains all the commands that should be tested (such as adding a student to an empty roster, 
listing out a full roster, deleting a nonexistent student from the roster, etc)

To test it with other files, input a new test file, run it through rostertest and store the output in another txt file, and then compare the differences between the 
generated output and expected output

If there's no difference between the outputs, then the test should indicate that
Ex terminal output for same test output and successful output:
268d267
